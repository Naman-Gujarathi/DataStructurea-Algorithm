In Tree defining a Node it has members Node left and Node right, datatype of members
itself is a Node I was Surprised which I should Imagine as a Blue print and to make
conenction rott.left and root.right


Depth First Search  three types :

1. Inorder Traversal : Left Root Right // consider it as direction if no choice than put value

4, 2, 8, 5, 1, 6, 3, 9, 7, 10

2. PreOrder Traversal : root left right // consider it as direction if no choice than put value

1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10

3. Post Order Traversal : left right root // consider it as direction if no choice than put value

4, 8, 5, 2, 6, 9, 10, 73, 1


PreOrder can be implemeted using stack without recusrsion just write right before left
while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            Nod node = stack.pop();
            System.out.print(node.data+ " ");
            if (node.right != null) {  // right before left
                stack.push(node.right);
            }
            if (node.left != null) {  
                stack.push(node.left);
            }
